HelloCellView
=============

Shows the text "Text", "Hypertext" or or other document type, based on the
MIME type of the document, or nothing if the item is no document.

Depends on presence of the `mime_type` property from the node information.

You can edit the `connection` and `node id` parameters in `test/index.html`
to be able to test the custom column with your server.  You need to add it
to the column collection of the table which you want to show it at.
